              <!-- Between 1981 and 2000 James F. Elliott was an associate (1981-1986) and partner (1986-2000) with Irell & Manella, one of the nation’s preeminent law firms, where he represented employers, including more than a dozen “Fortune 500 Companies,” as well as highly-compensated executives, in all manner employment disputes. Since 2000 Mr. Elliott has continued this practice with his own firm by exclusively representing executives and other employees in connection with employment termination cases and other employment disputes. Mr. Elliott therefore has the unusual distinction of having prosecuted on behalf of scores of employees and defended on behalf of employers in all phases of complex employment litigation in hundreds of cases in the state and federal courts throughout California, including discovery, motion practice, bench and jury trials, and appeal. His extensive experience representing management before turning to exclusively representing executives and employees has provided him with a perspective on management mindset and operations that has proven invaluable in representing executives and other employees who have been wrongly discharged or harassed. Mr. Elliott has been recognized in Martindale-Hubbell’s Bar Registry of Preeminent Lawyers and has served as a member of both the faculty of the National Institute for Trial Advocacy, the leading national institute for trial advocacy, and the Trial Attorney Project with the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office.
              <br><br>
              Mr. Elliott graduated Order of the Coif (5/115) in 1980 from the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law, where he earned numerous American Jurisprudence Awards, including in Constitutional Law, Remedies, Conflict of Laws and Advanced Torts, and served as the Articles Editor of the Arizona Law Review. He received his undergraduate education from Columbia University and the University of Arizona, graduating with highest distinction, Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi in 1976 from the University of Arizona Honors Program with a B.A. in political philosophy and double minor in philosophy and history.
              <br><br>
  
              After graduating from law school, Mr. Elliott served as a judicial law clerk to the Hon. Thomas Tang, United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.
              <br><br>
  
              Mr. Elliott is admitted to practice in California and Arizona and litigates in all California state and federal district courts. -->

                “I think that the lengths to which Claimant's counsel went in this
                case were heroic. I don't know how else to put it. It was a level of
                relentlessness in pursuing a claim that I rarely see, and it was the
                kind of case that required exactly that. I think most Plaintiff's
                counsel in this case -- I think that [two defense firms] -- I think
                you would have beat them. I think you would have won this case
                against almost any other group of attorneys.”

            <blockquote>
              Dear Jim:
              <br />
              I can’t tell you how much I appreciate all that you have done for
              me. You have literally given me my life and, more importantly, my
              dignity and self-respect back. I admire what you do and the
              professional and warn way you do it.
              <br />
              – S.B.

            <blockquote>
              Jim:
              <br />
              It is my humble wish that you accept my tokens of appreciation for
              your services rendered. I hope that they can say what words alone
              cannot begin to express. The independence, pride and tenacity of
              the American Eagle is consistent with the dignity and unflappable
              courage that you displayed. Bebe, the Goddess of youth and
              forgiveness, is symbolic of the hope and faith that you helped me
              t restore in my life during my time of need. I thank you, Nancy
              and your staff for going above and beyond the call of duty. Above
              all, I thank God for an attorney that has ultimately become a
              friend for life.
              <br />

            <blockquote>
              Dear Jim:
              <br />
              In the near twenty-five years I worked at the Court of Appeal, I
              have never seen a lawyer more brilliant than you, and that not
              only includes the lawyers in all those cases I worked on, but all
              the lawyers I have ever known personally. And I’ve never met a
              better, more caring, human being than you, Jim. There are no words
              to express how deeply [my husband] and I appreciate how you dealt
              with our case, or how lucky we felt to have you as our lawyer. I
              can’t even begin to imagine how many points my blood pressure
              dropped when you said you were taking the case. Knowing you were
              in charge of the case had such a calming effect. We always knew
              you would do the right thing, not just because of your brilliant
              mind, but because you cared about us and about doing the right
              thing. Your family must be so proud of you, not only because of
              your extraordinary mind, and professional achievements, but
              because of the depth of your character and integrity. So bearing
              in mind the fact that the English language seems inadequate to
              express our gratitude and our admiration – Thank you, thank you,
              thank you. <br />
              – M.W.
